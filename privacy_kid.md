## Third-Party Services

### Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)
Some of our apps include Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) for displaying advertisements. We follow [Google AdMob policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en) and have configured our implementation for Kids Category compliance:

**AdMob Configuration:**
- We have configured ads to be non-personalized only
- No personal information is collected for advertising purposes
- No tracking permissions are requested from users
- All ads are appropriate for children and comply with Google's Families Policy
- We use `tagForChildDirectedTreatment: true` and `tagForUnderAgeOfConsent: true`
- No behavioral targeting or user profiling is used
- Ad requests are configured to prevent personalized advertising

**AdMob Data Handling:**
- Google AdMob may collect standard advertising data (device type, app version, etc.)
- This data is used by Google for ad delivery and analytics
- We do not have access to or control over this data
- Google's privacy policy applies to AdMob data collection: [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

**Kids Category Compliance:**

### In-App Purchases
In-app purchases are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play Store:

- No personal data is collected during purchase process

### App Store Services
Our apps may integrate with standard App Store features:

## Parental Controls

Our apps include parental gates that require adult verification before:

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or store any personal information, there is no personal data to secure. Local game data is protected by your device's standard security measures.
