## Introduction

Rocky ("we," "our," or "us") develops educational games and apps for children. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our Kids Category apps.

## Kids Category Compliance

- No usage analytics or behavioral data
- No advertising identifiers (IDFA, AAID)

All game progress, settings, and preferences are stored locally on your device using your device's local storage. This information:

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or store any personal information, there is no personal data to secure. Local game data is protected by your device's standard security measures.
